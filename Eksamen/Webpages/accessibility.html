    <!--Accessibility test on the nav-bar and nav-dropdown-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Navigation bar</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">This navigation bar is created mainly for PC-screens and other wide forms of screens. We have ensured that all the elements are clearly visible and that these elements will 
    change color to white when hovered over.</p>
    <p class="accessibility-content">The accessibility test shows an alert on the Campus navigation element, this is because the "OsloMet" logo beside it is also clickable and will take the user to the Campus
    page. The accessibility test shows that this is a redundant link, but we think of it rather as a feature where if the user is confused, clicking the logo will always take them back to the main page.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveNavBar.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the main navigation bar">
    <p class="accessibility-content">The dropdown menu is only available when the screen width decreases past 1080 pixels, it will show up as a clickable "hamburger-menu". The purpose of the dropdown 
    menu is that it fits thinner screens.</p>

    <!--Accessibility test on Campus-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Campus</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">This is the introduction to the website. The page is made deliberately so that it pushes the focus towards the content. 
    The content of the page is therefore centered. We have consciously left whitespace on both sides of the content to balance our visual design and enhance the visual experience for the user.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveCampus.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Campus page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Topical-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Topical</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">This page is focused on the text, so the text is made very readable and without many distractions. That is why hyperlinks, are made to look like normal text. 
    On smaller screens the elements are rearranged, so that it fits smaller screens.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveTopical.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Topical page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Library-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Library</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">Here we used 'lorem ipsum' text as the main content. However, the header and sub-headers are relevant. For the text on top of the image we added a black
    see-through background to ensure a good contrast between text and background. Furthermore when the screens width decreases we have decided to put the image 
    picturing the students, at the bottom of the page to make sure that all the content is clearly visible regardless of what type of screen the user is using.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveLibrary.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Library page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Eateries-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Eateries</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">We have focused on presenting the eateries and cafes in the most organized, informative and uncomplicated manner for better accessibility.
    We have added images of each place, titles, location with link, clear description and opening hours. Moreover, icones underneath, that are meant to demonstrate that the each place offers vegetarian and gluten free options, as well as a coffee service.</p>
