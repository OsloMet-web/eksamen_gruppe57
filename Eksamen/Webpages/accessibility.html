    <!--Accessibility test on the nav-bar and nav-dropdown-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Navigation bar</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">This navigation bar is created mainly for PC-screens and other wide forms of screens. We have ensured that all the elements are clearly visible and that these elements will 
    change color to white when hovered over, making it easy for the user to see where their mouse is and what they are about to click.</p>
    <p class="accessibility-content">The accessibility test shows an alert on the Campus navigation element, this is because the "OsloMet" logo beside it is also clickable and will take the user to the Campus
    page. The accessibility test shows that this is a redundant link, but we think of it rather as a feature where if the user is confused, clicking the logo will always take them back to the main page.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveNavBar.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the main navigation bar">
    <p class="accessibility-content">The dropdown menu is only available when the screen width decreases past 1080 pixels, it will show up as a clickable "hamburger-menu". The purpose of the dropdown 
    menu is that it fits thinner screens. We have avoided the use of JavaScript by using a checkbox and a label to create a clickable area that serves as our dropdown menu.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveNavDropdown.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the dropdown navigation">
    <!--Accessibility test on Campus-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Campus</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">This is the introduction to the website. The page is made deliberately so that the user knows exactly what to look at and it pushes the focus towards the content. 
    The content of the page is therefore centered and we have also consciously left whitespace on both sides of the content to balance our visual design and enhance the visual experience for the user.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveCampus.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Campus page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Topical-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Topical</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">On this page we've made sure the text is easily readable at all screen widths, the clickable links containing more information appear at the bottom 
    of the screen when the screen-width decreases to increase readability. Furthermore when the links are hovered over they change color to indicate to the user what their mouse is hovering over. This page is 
    created with a focus on the information on the screen, avoiding other "flashy" content to engage the users focus onto the information.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveTopical.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Topical page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Library-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Library-page</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">For the library page we use lorem ipsum text as the main content. but the header and subheaders are relevant. For the text on top of the image we added a black
    see-through background to ensure a good contrast between text and background, this improves readability substantially. Furthermore when the screens width decreases we have decided to put the image, 
    picturing the students, at the bottom of the page to make sure that all the content is clearly visible regardless of what type of screen the user is using.</p>
    <img class="wave-test" src="../Images/waveLibrary.png" alt="WAVE accessibility test on the Library page">
    <!--Accessibility test on Eateries-->
    <h2 class="accessibility-subheader">Eateries</h2>
    <p class="accessibility-content">When developing the eateries page, we focused on presenting the eateries and cafes in the most organized and uncomplicated manner.
    Our primary focus was on being informativ through illustrative Images of each place, title, location with link, clear description of the place and opening hours.
    When it comes to the icones underneath, they are mean to illustrate that the each place offers vegetarain and gluten free options, as well as one with a coffe service.
    The tabindex was added to each Eatery for easier navigation.</p>
