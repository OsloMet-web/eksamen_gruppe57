                    <h1 class="topical-header">The Interplay between Technology and Society</h1>
                    <p class="topical-content">Todays society relies on the internet and with the satellite internet technology more people across the world can have access to a “larger part” of the world. 
                        The case is relevant to society, technology and our future profession in a way that we bear responsibility with future innovations, research and how we use technology, which Anders Braarud Hanssen introduce in module 1.4 (RRI). 
                        It is therefore important to look at how previous and current innovations can or will affect our society to prevent unintended consequences. 
                        Todays society relies on the internet and with the satellite internet technology more people across the world can have access to a “larger part” of the world.
                        Satellite internet technology opens up for people in countries with limited freedom to access information outside of the national border, 
                        and also for people living in rural areas where it's difficult to build ground internet. It makes for a more stable connection than ground internet as it won´t be affected by natural disasters. 
                        Negative sides comes with it as the upload and download speeds will not be as fast as fiber. </p>
                    <h2 class="topical-header">Satallites</h2>
                    <p class="topical-content">Satellite internet technology opens up for people in countries with limited freedom to access information outside of the national border, and also for people living in rural areas where it's difficult to build ground internet. 
                        It makes for a more stable connection than ground internet as it won´t be affected by natural disasters. 
                        Negative sides comes with it as the upload and download speeds won´t be as fast as fiber. 
                        It sounds great that more people can get access to the internet because it can be very useful in gathering information and connecting with people. </p>
                    <h3 class="topical-header">positive aspects</h3>
                        <p class="topical-content">The first positive aspect of this development is that it does not require cable and phone lining. Therefore, it is more convenient and accessible for people in developing countries, especially rural places where there are not enough resources to build infrastructure.
                            Second is that it is less expensive than installing fiber optic cable. In a developing country cable internet may not necessarily be the highest priority because it requires a lot of resources and time. And if more people get access to it, potentially it will get cheaper.
                            Lastly, it does not affect the environment as much as it would as installing underline cables, or big infrastructure for lining cables.</p>
                    <h4 class="topical-header">Negative aspects</h4>
                    <p class="topical-content">Although satellite internet technology is good for providing internet for people all over the world, it also impacts the environment. 
                        A satellite could potentially leave behind debris in space, which could interfere with other satellites.
                        Not everyone will be able to use the satellite internet because it`s still expensive to buy it 
                        Increases privacy concerns since satellites can be used by the government to track and monitor citizens.</p>
